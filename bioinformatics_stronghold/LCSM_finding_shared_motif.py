# Problem

# A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every
# member of the collection. We say that a common substring is a longest
# common substring if there does not exist a longer common substring.
# For example, "CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA",
# but it is not as long as possible; in this case, "CGTA" is a longest
# common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".

# Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for
# a simple example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings of
# "AACC" and "CCAA".

# Given: A collection of k(kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp
# each in FASTA format.

# Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple
# solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)
